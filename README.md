Code accompanying publication

Running script `workflow.R` should reproduce the analysis reported on in the publication. This uses initial data in `./data/endometrial_cancer_data/`

Functions are included in `housekeeping_functions.R`, are loaded at the beggining of `workflow.R` and consist of helper functions and a deterministic implementation of LDA in `train_lda()`.
